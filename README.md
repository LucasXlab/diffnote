Working-tree and staged changes become drafts; the showcase also covers metadata, review signals, and JSON. [Recording and reproduction](docs/showcase.md).

## Why diffnote?

The diff tells you what changed; a PR still needs a useful explanation. diffnote gives you a factual starting point from the selected changes. Add your intent and the verification you actually performed before publishing the draft.

## Quick start

Python 3.11+ and Git 2.31+ on macOS or Linux. The demo uses disposable synthetic Git data; installation may download build tools.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install .
.venv/bin/python scripts/demo.py
```

## Usage

### Describe the next commit

```bash
diffnote --staged --markdown
```

Activate `.venv` first. This selects the index. Without `--staged`, tracked working-tree changes include staged edits; untracked files enter the report only after staging.

### Select a branch comparison or structured output

```bash
diffnote --base main --markdown
diffnote --range main...feature --markdown
diffnote --staged --json
```

`A..B` compares committed endpoints; `A...B` compares the merge base to B. Working/staged titles come from current changed paths rather than an unrelated previous commit.

Exit `0` means supported analysis completed, not approval of the change. Exit `2` covers usage, Git, size, timeout, and parsing failures. No project tests are executed.

## Scope

A draft does not establish intent, semantic correctness, or safety. Unsupported patches and incomplete Git data fail explicitly. Reports contain actual paths and subjects; inspect before sharing. Global/helper configuration defenses do not sandbox a malicious Git executable.

See the [usage guide](docs/guide.md) for more examples, exact parameters, and technical boundaries.

## Contributing

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Use synthetic reproductions and report the validation you actually ran.
